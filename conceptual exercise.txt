1. Differences
Some differences between Python and JS is the syntax, the usage, and types

2. Dictionary
To get a missing key you can use the "get" method or you can use the try and except but in my opionion get is the simplier therefore more efficient method. 

3. Unit Test
Checks a portion of your code to make sure it runs correct.

4. Integration Test 
Checks if several portions run correctly together

5. Role of application framework 
Provides tools to handle requests and routing

6. Better fit for application
Use a route URL parameter for essential info, like a user ID in /user/123.

7. How to Collect Data using Flask
Define it in the route then access it in the function.

8.  Query string with flask
request.args

9. Data from body with flask
request.json

10. What is a Cookie
Data stored in a web browser ex. remembering your login password for next time.
11. Session Object Flask
Stores data like login access for websites
12. Flask's jsonify() 
Takes your python and turns it to JSON to be easy for the api to understand

def get_data():
    data = {'key': 'value'}
    return jsonify(data)
